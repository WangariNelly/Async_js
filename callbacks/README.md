## Calback functions

Functions passed as arguments to other functions and invoked later after sometime or if a particular even occurs.

Callback functions are commonly used in scenarios such as:
Asynchronous operations like fetching data from a server or reading files.
    Event handling, where a callback is triggered when a specific event occurs.
       Iterating over arrays or collections, where a callback is applied to each element.
